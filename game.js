GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times they want. Each result gets added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a '1', all his ROUND score gets deleted. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Keep', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points wins the game
